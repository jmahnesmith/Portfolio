<p>Hi! My name is Josh and I enjoy creative problem solving and all things technology!
    My interest started back in 2012 when I built my first computer and everything snowballed from there!
    I enrolled at my local community collage and graduated with a degree in network security.
    My first job out of college offered courses where I could learn how to program.
